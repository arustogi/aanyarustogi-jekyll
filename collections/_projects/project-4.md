## Key Features
### **Document Upload & Embedding Generation**
Users can easily upload academic documents (PDFs, notes, past papers, etc.), and the system will automatically generate embeddings that represent the core content. These embeddings form the backbone of the study schedule, ensuring that each task is directly tied to relevant materials.

### **Personalized Study Schedules**
The app goes beyond basic planning—it uses the generated embeddings and user-provided deadlines to produce an accurate, dynamic study schedule. Each task is aligned with specific sections of the uploaded documents, ensuring you know exactly what to focus on and when.

### **Asynchronous Background Processing**
To handle large datasets and complex schedules, the application uses asynchronous processing to manage the study schedule generation. Users can upload extensive materials, and the system will efficiently generate their personalized plans in the background, allowing them to continue with other tasks seamlessly.

### **Responsive User Interface**
Built with React, the app offers a clean, intuitive interface that provides users with a seamless experience. Users can easily upload their documents, view the generated schedules in a clear tabular format, and adjust deadlines to see instant updates. The interface is mobile-friendly, ensuring that students can access their schedules from anywhere, on any device.

### **Serverless & Scalable Architecture**
Powered by AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, and API Gateway, the system ensures scalability, security, and reliability. Whether you're an individual student or part of a larger educational institution, **Academic Resource Optimizer** is designed to handle a wide range of workloads, providing high performance even under heavy usage.
