## Overview
**MarketMind** is an AI-powered platform designed to provide real-time, accurate financial analysis. It integrates multiple AI agents to process stock market data, verify information, and deliver actionable insights. By using various APIs and financial data sources, the platform helps investors make informed decisions through robust data verification, stock analysis, and insight generation.

The system uses LangChain agents and OpenAI's models to provide financial data, verify it, and break down complex metrics into easy-to-understand insights. Users can interact with the platform via a sleek, intuitive Streamlit interface that allows them to query financial data, verify its accuracy, and gain deep insights through powerful visualizations.

## Key Features
### **Intent Clarification and Query Refinement**
The Intent Agent clarifies user queries to ensure that the system provides the exact financial data or analysis being requested. It refines the question and ensures all necessary details are collected before moving to data retrieval.

### **Data Retrieval and Analysis**
The Data Agent extracts relevant financial data from CSV files or APIs and analyzes it to provide the requested financial information. This includes retrieving stock prices, analyzing historical performance, and offering predictive insights.

### **Data Verification**
A dedicated Verification Agent checks the accuracy of the data extracted by the Data Agent. It cross-references the data against reliable sources and ensures that any data discrepancies are addressed before presenting the information to the user.

### **Insight Generation**
Using an Insight Agent, MarketMind breaks down complex financial metrics and trends into easy-to-understand insights, offering investors a clearer understanding of market movements and potential investment strategies.

### **Streamlit User Interface**
The platform uses Streamlit to provide a clean and user-friendly interface. Users can interact with the AI agents, submit financial queries, and view the results in interactive, data-rich visualizations. The responsive design ensures a smooth experience across all devices.
